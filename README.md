# pGen - simply manage your passwords
pGen is a simple open-source (but code is just a mess) user-friendly password generator that also can keep your passwords safe and sound

# Features
- a password generator that can use wanted length of password or specific characters (for example: only letters or letters + numbers or other symbols + numbers)
- you can always save the password you liked
- all passwords will be stored in txt file being encrypted, so no one except you (or someone else who will open this program) can see it
- simple and not overweight UI

# Any questions? Ð¡ontact me
This program is in development now, soooo... this might be why the code is really bad or there are some critical bugs.
If you have any problems or questions - contact me.
